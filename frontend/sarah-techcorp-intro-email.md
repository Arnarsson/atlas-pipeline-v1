Hi Sarah,

Great connecting with you on LinkedIn! I saw your post about TechCorp's innovation initiatives and your interest in AI automation solutions.

Based on your role as VP of Innovation at TechCorp Solutions, I thought you might be interested in our AI automation consulting services. We've helped companies like yours:

- Reduce operational costs by 35-45%
- Streamline decision-making processes
- Implement custom AI solutions for workflow automation
- Scale innovation programs efficiently

I'd love to share some case studies relevant to your industry and discuss how we could support TechCorp's automation goals.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation next week? I'm available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
